# 🎮 Reinforcement Learning
Learning through interaction with environments.

## 📖 Overview

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful machine learning paradigm where agents learn to make sequential decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards. RL has enabled breakthrough applications in robotics, game playing, autonomous systems, and recommendation engines.
